# My 1337-med pool experience

Hello, and welcome everybody to my first poor blog :) on this pool webpage. I had the idea of writing this blog when i was in the pool, but i was really busy back then, playing ping pong and doing my projects hhh. And the pupose of this is sharing with you my little experience in 1337-med pool, how it was, and what you will  probably get out of it, with some adivse and tips to boost your pool, or maybe not hhhhhhhhh(it all depends on you).


So, let's begin. It all started on 2022/03/xx, we got our badges, and went directly to the meeting room, and there where the staff started explaining  how things work in 1337, what should we except, and some other technical stuff, which you will  know when you get there,so be patient hehehe ;). After that, we headed to the cluster ( oh yeah, the cluster wa ma adrak ma cluster hhh), luckly we were the first ones in the 1337-med pool and that's why you will find that all the emacs are naked (HEHEHEHE), cause we took their covers off of course.


My first day was all just pure discovery, from looking at the website pages, and how I am supposed to do my tasks, to playing pig pong in the playground, and kicking people butts each time I play with someone hahahaha, and I think this is what happens in every pool in the world, just a day full of discovery and joy. As second day came, I already have crafted my stuff, and started working on my projects. The way we progress in the system and how we gain exp, it all feels like being in a game , when u need power to start so that you can gain some experience and gold ( aka evaluation points in 1337 words). Well, it was designed to be like a game in first place, and that’s  why you won't get bored while doing your projects and leveling up.


The following weeks, were all just repeated cycles, with different projects and new stuff to learn as long as we progress in the system . One of the things i loved about the school is that it’s open 24/7, giving us the freedom to study according to our own schedulde, restricting no body from being able to choose the time he wants to study, relax, or even play at. Thus,  if you are well oraganized in terms of time, you will do just fine there. It’s no doubt that  the school was ranked the 4th out of 100 of the most creative schools in the world, which is a big honor for everybody to belonging  to this incredible network.


Well, well, since you have reached to this point reading my stuff , i should bonus you with some protien, oh i mean adivses , and tips, with some resources that will help you in your progress during the poool, hoping you all get something  out of this blog.


# ADVISES:
0. Study some regex, it will help u in some of the shell exercises.
1. Study algorithms, if you haven’t already..
2. Study recursion, if ur willing to score 100%in some of the projects..
3.  RTFM (aka read the fucking manual).
4. Be kind to your peer, and help who is in need when you are free.
5. Never leave your session open, or some bad stuff will happen!

# And know let's move to the obvious stuff, but its not that crystal clear for everybody:
1. Respect your peers, staff, and the security guys.
2. Cluster is meant for studying, not playing around, so when ur in the cluster work, study help, and don’t cause noise to ur peers, they re trying to focus and work as well.
3. Playground existed just so that you could have some fun, after working and feeling tired, and need some break.
4. keep the school, and especially ur place clean, since ur in it, then it belongs to u, so keep safe and clean.

# Lessons gained from the pool:

1. Collaboration is king( btw i prefer working alone, but sometimes u need to work in team to achieve the big goals in shorter time).
2. You can learn a lot in  a small period of time if ur willing to .

# RESOURCES:
1. RTFM (HEHEHEHEH).
2. YOUTUBE.
3. GOOGLE.
4. Your peers.
