#   My 1337-med pool experience


Hello, and welcome everybody to my first poor blog :) on this poor webpage. I had the idea of writing this blog when I was in the pool, but I was really busy back then, playing ping pong and doing my projects hhh. And the purpose of this is to share with you my little experience in the 1337-med pool, how it was, and what you will probably get out of it, with some advice and tips to boost your pool, or maybe not hhhhhhhhh(it all depends on you).


So, let's begin. It all started on 2022/03/21, we got our badges, and went directly to the meeting room, and there where the staff started explaining how things work in 1337, what we should expect, and some other technical stuff, which you will know when you get there, so be patient ;). After that, we headed to the cluster ( oh yeah, the cluster wa ma adrak ma cluster hhh), luckily we were the first ones in the 1337-med pool and that's why you will find that all the emacs are naked (HEHEHEHE), cause we took their covers off of course.

My first day was all just pure discovery, from looking at the website pages, and how I am supposed to do my tasks, to playing ping pong in the playground, and kicking people's butts each time I play with someone hahahaha, and I think this is what happens in every pool in the world, just a day full of discovery and joy. When the second day came, I already have crafted my stuff and started working on my projects. The way we progress in the system and how we gain exp, it all feels like being in a game, when u need power to start so that you can gain some experience and gold ( aka evaluation points in 1337 words). Well, it was designed to be like a game in the first place, and that’s why you won't get bored while doing your projects and leveling up.

In the following weeks, it was all just repeated cycles, with different guys to play ping pong against, and different projects to deal with, plus some new stuff to learn as long as we progress in the system. One of the things I loved about the school is that it’s open 24/7, giving us the freedom to study according to our schedule, restricting nobody from being able to choose the time he wants to study, relax, or even play at. Thus, if you are well organized in terms of time, you will do just fine there. It’s no doubt that the school was ranked the 4th out of 100 of the most creative schools in the world, which is a big honor for everybody to belong to this incredible network.


Well, well, since you have reached this point reading my stuff, I should bonus you with some protein, oh I mean advice, and tips, with some resources that will help you in your progress during the pool, hoping you all get something out of this blog.


# ADVISES:
1. Study some regex, it will help u in some of the shell exercises.
2. Study algorithms, if you haven’t already.
3. Study recursion, if ur willing to score 100%in some of the projects.
4. RTFM (aka read the fucking manual).
5. Be kind to your peers, and help those who are in need when you are free.
6. Never leave your session open, or some bad stuff will happen!
7. If you are a mssemen fan, I want to tell u that there are no places to buy mssemen from near the school, so get it when ur home hhhh.
 
# And now let's move to the obvious stuff, but it's not that crystal clear for everybody:
1. Respect your peers, staff, and the security guys.
2. The cluster is meant for studying, not playing around, so when ur in the cluster work, study help, and don’t cause noise to ur peers, they're trying to focus and work as well.
3. Playground existed just so that you could have some fun, after working and feeling tired, and need some break.
4. keep the school, and especially ur place clean, since ur in it, then it belongs to u, so keep safe and clean.
 
# Lessons gained from the pool:
1. Collaboration is king( btw I prefer working alone, but sometimes u need to work in a team to achieve the big goals in a shorter time).
2. You can learn a lot in a small period if ur willing to.

# RESOURCES:
1. RTFM (HEHEHEHEH).
2. YOUTUBE.
3. GOOGLE.
4. Your peers.
